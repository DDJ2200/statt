Binomial Distribution \\


Q] suppose there are 12 multiple choice quest  in an english class quiz each quest have five possible ans, and only one of them is correct.write a R code to find the probability of having 4 or less correct ans
#code:

x=dbinom(4,size=12,prob=0.2)
sprintf("%s is the probability of attempting 4 questtion correctly",x)
y=pbinom(4,size=12,prob=0.2)
sprintf("%s is the probability of attempting lessthan equal to 4",y)


Q] write a R code to plot a binomial distribution with random taking values from 0 to 50 an probability of success is 0.5
#code:

x=seq(0,50,by=1)
print(x)
y=dbinom(x,50,0.5)
png(file="dbinom.png")
plot(x,y)
dev.off()


Q] write  R code to find the number of reads that have a probability  of  0.25 will come out when a coin is tossed
#code:

x=qbinom(0.25,51,0.5)
sprintf("%s is the number of times head appers in 51 trial if probability is 0.25",x)





Normal Distribution\\

Q] write a R code to plot a normal distribution with random variable taking values between   -10   to 10 ,mean=2.5, & s.d=2
#code:

x=seq (-10,10,by=0.1)
y=dnorm(x,mean=2.5,sd=2)
png(file="pnormExample.png")
plot(x,y)
dev.off()
